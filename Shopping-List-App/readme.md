# Shopping List App

This project is inspired by one of my favorite teachers on Udemy, Brad Traversy. It's a shopping list app that I will be rebuilding to reinforce what I've learned so far and continue developing my skills as I work through the course.

## Project Goals

- Rebuild the app using modern JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Implement dynamic features, such as adding, removing, and editing items in the list.
- Learn and apply best practices in front-end development and design.
- Track my progress and reflect on my improvements over time.

## Roadmap

This project will take several months to complete, as I plan to work through various stages and incorporate new concepts learned from Brad’s course. I’ll be revisiting and refining the app continuously to improve my skills.

## Special Thanks

A big thank you to **Brad Traversy** for creating such an insightful course. His teaching style has been incredibly helpful and has inspired me to take my development skills to the next level. I'm excited to continue learning and applying what I’ve learned!
